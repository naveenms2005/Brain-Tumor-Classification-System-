# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification System

This project implements a **Brain Tumor Classification System** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect tumor types from MRI images. It uses a custom-trained model and offers an interactive **Gradio UI** for image-based predictions.

## 🔍 Features

- Classifies MRI scans into: **glioma**, **meningioma**, **notumor**, **pituitary**
- Uses **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training a CNN
- Handles image preprocessing with **OpenCV**
- **LabelBinarizer** for multi-class output
- **Gradio** interface for easy drag-and-drop predictions

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load and preprocess brain MRI images (resized to 128x128).
2. Train a CNN model using `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling`, and `Dropout` layers.
3. Use the trained model to classify new images uploaded via the Gradio interface.
4. Display prediction results with confidence scores.
